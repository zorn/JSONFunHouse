# JSONFunHouse

This demo app was built to support a presentation introducing Freddy, a new Swift library for working with JSON from Big Nerd Ranch.

In the app we setup various scenarios and present solutions using native Swift, Freddy, SwiftyJSON and Argo.

## Known Issues

* The way we use storyboards is not DRY. Should probably break them down into XIBs.
* Not all the demos are setup the same way. Could try for more consistency.

## Feedback Welcome

I'd love to hear what you think of Freddy or any other aspect of this demo.
